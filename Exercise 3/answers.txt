When smoothing the CPU temperature, do you think you got a better result with LOESS or Kalman smoothing? What differences did you notice?
Answer:I think the LOESS smoothing was better. Kalman was more sensitive to the noises in the data. Loes was more stable and less prone to the noises.


In the GPX files, you might have also noticed other data about the observations: time stamp, course (heading in degrees from north, 0–360), speed (in m/s). How could those have been used to make a better prediction about the “next” latitude and longitude? [Aside: I tried, and it didn't help much. I think the values are calculated from the latitude/longitude by the app: they don't really add much new information.]
Answer: Speed and heading could have been used to calculate the velocity in the x and y direction. This could have been used to predict the next latitude and longitude. On top of that, the time stamp could have been used to calculate the time between the observations. This could have been used to calculate the distance between the observations and thus get a second data point for velocity. This could have been used to give a higher degree of confidence to the gps location prediction.
